# CPU_Simulator
**Usage
After running the simulator, input assembly code (using a custom instruction set) to simulate CPU operations.

** Example instruction set:

ADD R1, R2: Add the values of registers R1 and R2.
MOV R1, R2: Move the value from R1 to R2.
JMP 100: Jump to instruction at memory address 100.

The simulator will display the state of the registers, memory, and the result of each instruction after execution.
